Datasheets
==========
It is not always clear to me whether or not I would have permission to
re-distribute datasheets. So rather than take the risk,
`getdatasheets.sh` will fetch them from the location where they were
found.

There are more links and descriptions in embedded in the comments in
`getdatasheets.sh`.

To avoid accidentally commiting datasheets, `.gitignore` excludes all
`.pdf` and `.jpg` files.
